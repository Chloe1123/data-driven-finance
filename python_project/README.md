## **1. Gold Market Analysis** *(Latest Project)*  
This project examines **gold price trends and macroeconomic influences** using time-series analysis and predictive modeling.  

### **Key Components:**  
- **Macroeconomic Factors**: Analyzes the relationship between gold prices and inflation (CPI), treasury yields, and currency strength (USD Index).  
- **Volatility and Trend Analysis**: Applies Bollinger Bands, RSI, and MACD to assess market momentum and price fluctuations.  
- **Predictive Modeling**: Utilizes statistical models, including GARCH, to forecast volatility and potential future price movements.  

### **Data Visualization:**  
- **Gold Price Trends Over Time**: A time-series line chart with annotations for key macroeconomic events.  
- **Macroeconomic Correlation Heatmap**: Highlights the relationships between gold prices and external economic indicators.  
- **Volatility Analysis**: Bollinger Bands and ATR plotted over price movements to illustrate market uncertainty.  
- **Momentum & Trend Indicators**: RSI and MACD plotted as subcharts for enhanced trend recognition.

## **2. Risk Analysis and Portfolio Optimization**  
This project focuses on **quantitative risk assessment** and **investment portfolio optimization**, applying statistical models and simulations to achieve an optimal balance between risk and return.  

### **Key Components:**  
- **Stock Analysis**: Evaluates individual stock performance using historical trends, moving averages, returns, and volatility, benchmarked against the S&P 500.  
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Implements Monte Carlo simulations, mean-variance optimization, and Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to construct efficient investment portfolios.  
- **Risk Management**: Applies Value at Risk (VaR), Conditional VaR (CVaR), and the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to quantify portfolio risks and potential losses.

## **3. NYC Shooting Incident Data Analysis**  
This project conducts a **spatial and temporal analysis** of gun violence in New York City, using statistical and geospatial techniques to identify crime patterns.  

### **Key Components:**  
- **Geospatial Data Analysis**: Maps shooting incidents across NYC census tracts from 2017 to 2022.  
- **Spatial Statistics**: Utilizes Moranâ€™s I test to detect spatial clustering of shooting incidents.  
- **Crime Hotspot Identification**: Applies Kernel Density Estimation and Quadrat Analysis to highlight high-risk areas.  
- **Temporal Trends**: Analyzes seasonal variations and time-of-day patterns in shooting incidents.
